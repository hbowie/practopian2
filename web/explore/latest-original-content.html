					<p>By Herb Bowie </p>
					<p><p>What does it mean to be human? This must certainly be a foundational question for all of us, when  contemplating almost any aspect of our existence. </p>

					<p>By Herb Bowie </p>
					<p><p>I first came across Ken Wilber's work late in the last century when a friend handed me a copy of <cite>A Brief History of Everything</cite> as a birthday present. Wilber has described four quadrants of human knowledge, each representing a different and valid perspective on the same reality. </p>

					<p>By Herb Bowie </p>
					<p><p>When it comes to religion, I have to confess to being a bit of a mongrel. My mother was a Methodist. My father was a nudist. And I once called myself an immortalist. These days I choose not to align myself with any particular religious group. </p>

					<p>By Herb Bowie </p>
					<p><p>Human records indicate that some sort of belief in a God or collection of gods is a feature of almost all human culture. No matter what the continent or age, a belief in powerful, supernatural beings that somehow influence human existence is a near-constant. </p>

					<h3><a href="../blog/hbowie/reasons-for-belief.html">Reasons for Belief</a></h3>
					<p>By Herb Bowie </p>
					<p><p>We often seem to assume that people say things, and come to believe them, because they are true. It seems to me, though, that people take up beliefs for a whole host of reasons, and the likely truth or falsehood of these statements is often the least of the motivating factors at work. </p>

					<p>By Herb Bowie </p>
					<p><p>We tend to divide up human history into relatively neat periods, and give them names like &#8220;The Agrarian Era,&#8221; &#8220;The Age of Industrialization&#8221; and &#8220;The Information Age.&#8221; When I look at what's going on around me today and try to make sense of it, I am forced to draw the conclusion that we are deep&#8230;. </p>
