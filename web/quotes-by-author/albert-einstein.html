<h2>Quotations by Albert Einstein</h2>
<p class="sourceline">
From <cite class='majortitle'>The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein</cite>, <span class='datepublished'>18 September 1896</span>
</p>
<h3>A Happy Man</h3>
<p>tags: <a href='../tags/progress.html' rel='tag'>progress</a></p>
<blockquote>
A happy man is too satisfied with the present to dwell too much on the future.

</blockquote>
<h3>Only a Human Being</h3>
<p>tags: <a href='../tags/cultural-evolution.html' rel='tag'>cultural evolution</a>, <a href='../tags/humanism.html' rel='tag'>humanism</a></p>
<blockquote>
I am by heritage a Jew, by citizenship a Swiss, and by makeup a human being, and <em>only</em> a human being, without any special attachment to any state or national entity whatsoever.

<h3>Moral Religion</h3>
<p>tags: <a href='../tags/cultural-evolution.html' rel='tag'>cultural evolution</a>, <a href='../tags/religion.html' rel='tag'>religion</a>, <a href='../tags/rule-of-law.html' rel='tag'>rule of law</a></p>
<blockquote>
The Jewish scriptures admirably illustrate the development from the religion of fear to moral religion, a development continued in the New Testament. The religions of all civilized peoples, especially the peoples of the Orient, are primarily moral religions. The development from a religion of fear to moral religion is a great step in peoples' lives. And yet, that primitive religions are based entirely on fear and the religions of civilized peoples purely on morality is a prejudice against which we must be on our guard. The truth is that all religions are a varying blend of both types, with this differentiation: that on the higher levels of social life the religion of morality predominates.

<h3>This Highest Kind of Religious Feeling</h3>
<p>tags: <a href='../tags/cultural-evolution.html' rel='tag'>cultural evolution</a>, <a href='../tags/religion.html' rel='tag'>religion</a>, <a href='../tags/wonder.html' rel='tag'>wonder</a></p>
<blockquote>
The beginnings of cosmic religious feeling already appear at an early stage of development, e.g., in many of the Psalms of David and in some of the Prophets. Buddhism, as we have learned especially from the wonderful writings of Schopenhauer, contains a much stronger element of this. The religious geniuses of all ages have been distinguished by this kind of religious feeling, which knows no dogma and no God conceived in man's image; so that there can be no church whose central teachings are based on it. Hence it is precisely among the heretics of every age that we find men who were filled with this highest kind of religious feeling and were in many cases regarded by their contemporaries as atheists, sometimes also as saints.

<h3>The Supreme Goal of All Theory</h3>
<p>tags: <a href='../tags/science.html' rel='tag'>science</a></p>
<blockquote>
...the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.

<h3>Violent Opposition from Mediocre Minds</h3>
<p>tags: <a href='../tags/critical-thinking.html' rel='tag'>critical thinking</a>, <a href='../tags/science.html' rel='tag'>science</a></p>
<blockquote>
Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds. The mediocre mind is incapable of understanding the man who refuses to bow blindly to conventional prejudices and chooses instead to express his opinions courageously and honestly.

<h3>To Give in the Same Measure</h3>
<p>tags: <a href='../tags/connection.html' rel='tag'>connection</a>, <a href='../tags/mission.html' rel='tag'>mission</a></p>
<blockquote>
How strange is the lot of us mortals! Each of us is here for a brief sojourn; for what purpose he knows not, though he sometimes thinks he senses it. But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people -- first of all for those upon whose smiles and well-being our own happiness is wholly dependent, and then for the many, unknown to us, to whose destinies we are bound by the ties of sympathy. A hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving....

<h3>The Mysterious</h3>
<p>tags: <a href='../tags/art.html' rel='tag'>art</a>, <a href='../tags/religion.html' rel='tag'>religion</a>, <a href='../tags/science.html' rel='tag'>science</a>, <a href='../tags/wonder.html' rel='tag'>wonder</a></p>
<blockquote>
The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science. Whoever does not know it and can no longer wonder, no longer marvel, is as good as dead, and his eyes are dimmed. It was the experience of mystery -- even if mixed with fear -- that engendered religion. A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, our perceptions of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty, which only in their most primitive forms are accessible to our minds: it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute true religiosity. In this sense, and only this sense, I am a deeply religious man.

<h3>A Man of Value</h3>
<p>tags: <a href='../tags/value-creation.html' rel='tag'>value creation</a></p>
<blockquote>
Try to become not a man of success, but try rather to become a man of value.

</blockquote>
<h3>Simplicity and Complexity</h3>
<p>tags: <a href='../tags/science.html' rel='tag'>science</a></p>
<blockquote>
Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.
