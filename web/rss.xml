			&lt;p&gt;With a little luck, and a lot of hard work, we might be fortunate enough to see Donald Trump leave office in a few months. If so, that will be the end of the Trump presidency. Unfortunately, though, it won&apos;t mean the end of Trumpism. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When we look at the major societal choices facing us today, the primary question is not whether we want a society that is more cooperative or more competitive, but whether we&apos;re ready for a society that is less coercive. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As with many of us, I&apos;ve been thinking deeply lately about the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breanna Taylor, and so many other people of color, and wondering how and why these atrocities continue to occur in my country, and what we can do to turn things around. And I&apos;ve concluded that there are basically two types of human societies, with very different ways of thinking about themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As Americans we generally believe in capitalism as a superior economic system, and are typically convinced that our country is run on capitalistic principles. But I&apos;ve been wondering lately: If these things are really true, then why do so few Americans actually possess any capital? &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;I recently came across the Playing for Change Song Around the World video of Robbie Robertson&apos;s composition &amp;#8220;The Weight,&amp;#8221; and it made me want to think &amp;#8211; and write! &amp;#8211; more deeply about how this song works, and what it means, and the timeless nature of its appeal. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As humans our superpower is the ability to work cooperatively with others of our species. But these seemingly simple ideas of cooperation and coordination turn out to be devilishly complex in practice, especially in large undertakings. In an organization of any appreciable size, all of the following patterns of cooperation can be found. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When I was in school, history was one of my least favorite subjects: It just seemed like a bunch of arbitrary names and dates and events that I had to memorize. In hindsight, I realize now, the problem I had with the subject was that it had been &amp;#8220;storified.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As we move into the 2020 election season in the US, I thought it might be useful to point out some things that Donald Trump gets right. If you&apos;re concerned about electability, then please pay attention to how your candidates navigate their ways through these seven minefields. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As 2019 winds to a close, and we pause briefly to compose ourselves before finding out what 2020 has in store, I want to take a moment to offer up a prayer &amp;#8211; not to God, but to all of us &amp;#8211; for a more integral sense of who we are in the new year. &lt;/p&gt;

		<description>
			&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that this conflict between the personal and the institutional is a false dichotomy. While we are right to believe that the ultimate goal of human society is the welfare of the individual persons within that society, it is folly to believe that these ends can be met without participation in and reliance on human institutions. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When it comes to religion, the main question for most people is whether to keep the one we were raised with or to lose it altogether. But now I&apos;m starting to wonder whether, instead of losing my religion, it might not be better just to rejigger it a bit? &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;No matter what your age or orientation, it&apos;s hard to gainsay the significance of humankind&apos;s first trip through space to set foot on a celestial body other than our birth planet. Of course fictional space flight has become so common that sitting down for two hours to watch a documentary about a real trip that took place half a century ago might seem like a somewhat pedestrian enterprise. Ah, but there&apos;s where you&apos;d be wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
