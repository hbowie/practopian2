<p>This is a rather amazing song by The Kinks, first released in 1968. </p>
<p>I loved this song from the moment I first heard it, but my appreciation for it has only grown over the years. </p>
<p>Consider: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the same year that John Lennon and Yoko Ono released an album called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfinished_Music_No._1:_Two_Virgins"><em>Two Virgins</em></a> (certainly using the term to refer to themselves metaphorically, not literally), with an album cover showing the two artists completely naked, Ray Davies wrote a song with the immortal line, &#8220;God save little shops, china cups and virginity&#8221; (and Davies, to be clear,  delivered this line quite seriously and quite literally); </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A year before Jefferson Airplane released its album <em>Volunteers</em>, delivering the injunction &#8220;Got to revolution,&#8221; and noting that &#8220;One generation got old, one generation got soul,&#8221; Ray Davies was singing &#8220;God save the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Cross">George Cross</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_George_Cross_recipients">all those who were awarded them</a>&#8221;; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just one year after The Beatles released &#8220;Penny Lane,&#8221; an endearing song of sentimental childhood nostalgia, Ray Davies fashioned a song that used references to traditional English items, and fading elements of popular culture, not just for a walk down memory lane, but as part of an enduring anthem upholding the value of social continuity. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The lyrics are a treat all on their own, but the music adds a whole 'nother dimension to it, so be sure to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-village-green-preservation-society/1142638349?i=1142638545">listen</a> as well as read. </p>
<blockquote>

 God save strawberry jam and all the different varieties.</p>
<p>Preserving the old ways from being abused;  <br />
 Protecting the new ways, for me and for you:  <br />
 What more can we do?  </p>

<p>Note that the song exhibits many of the same virtues that it extols, being itself small, carefully crafted and unassuming. </p>
<p>There are a number of elements of this song that I find remarkable: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Its emphasis on social unity, created through the repetition of the phrases &#8220;We are&#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;God save the&#8230;&#8221; as well as by the understated, smoothly harmonizing vocals from the band members; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its emphasis on critical elements of social progress: preserving the old ways, while still protecting the new ways; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its emphasis on humanizing our society, both by respect for the inexplicable quirks of popular culture, as well as buildings designed for humans, rather than large institutions; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its emphasis on common action, created through the various different types of organizations cited, and even drawing the listener in through the concluding question, &#8220;What more can we do?&#8221; </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thematically, the song can easily be thought of as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Santayana">George Santayana</a> set to music. Here are some similar thoughts, from his 1906 work, <a href="https://amzn.to/2NW369m"><em>The Life of Reason: Reason in Common Sense</em></a>:    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Progress, far from consisting in change, depends on retentiveness. When change is absolute there remains no being to improve and no direction is set for possible improvement: and when experience is not retained &#8230; infancy is perpetual. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The song seems even more relevant today than when it was first released, for several reasons: </p>
<ol>
<li>As growing environmental issues have us all watching the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">Tragedy of the commons</a> playing out on a global scale, we can see The Kinks' concern for saving the village green in a new light; </li>
<li>As we see England, America and other countries facing increasing polarization dividing their urban and rural populations, we can appreciate the value of Davies' respect for traditional, village life; </li>
<li>As we observe the terrible toll on our society taken by tech companies whose motto is &#8220;Move fast and break things,&#8221; we can gain new respect for the singers' avowed mission of &#8220;Preserving the old ways from being abused&#8221; and &#8220;Protecting the new ways, for me and for you.&#8221; </li>
</ol>
<p>Ray Davies and The Kinks certainly recorded a number of great songs, but this one, I think, really stands alone for me. It's hard to think of a comparable song, from any artist, that so calls upon us as listeners to knit together the splintered pieces of our society into a coherent whole that works for all of us. </p>
<p>What more, indeed, can we ask an artist to do? </p>
