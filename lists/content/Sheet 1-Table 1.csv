Unable to find a neat place for it in their developmental models of civilization, they end up citing that old chestnut of ""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" and leaving it at that, as an entirely subjective experience. Everyone's idea of beauty can be different, they say, and they're all equally valid. Of course, I've never run across an actual artist who sees things this way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As I've remarked elsewhere, when it comes to religion, I'm a bit of a mongrel, so my approach to the holidays, while imbued with many of the traditional practices and stories associated with a good Methodist upbringing, does not hew closely to any particular set of Christian dictates. But that's perhaps as it should be, for Christmas, it seems to me, has always been too big a thing to be narrowly claimed by any particular religious organization. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No matter what the continent or age, a belief in powerful, supernatural beings that somehow influence human existence is a near-constant. At the same time, though, many skeptics have persistently questioned the existence of such a being, and beliefs about the attributes of God have exhibited wide variation, with such variations often being so deeply held that wars have been fought to advance one sort of belief over another. Rather than approach the question of God's existence directly, it seems wiser to ask ourselves how we can best explain the facts above -- the combination of a nearly universal human belief in God, combined with so far irreconcilable differences in what sort of God we believe in.
