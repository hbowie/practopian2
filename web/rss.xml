&lt;p&gt;We believe in democracy, with all citizens having an equal say in defining their society&apos;s laws, and an equal opportunity to influence their governments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffering through a pandemic is a terrible way to have to learn a lesson or two about the nature of humanity. But it&apos;s what we have, so we may as well make use of it. &lt;/p&gt;

<description>
&lt;p&gt;As Americans we generally believe in capitalism as a superior economic system, and are typically convinced that our country is run on capitalistic principles. But I&apos;ve been wondering lately: If these things are really true, then why do so few Americans actually possess any capital? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently came across the Playing for Change Song Around the World video of Robbie Robertson&apos;s composition &amp;#8220;The Weight,&amp;#8221; and it made me want to think &amp;#8211; and write! &amp;#8211; more deeply about how this song works, and what it means, and the timeless nature of its appeal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As humans our superpower is the ability to work cooperatively with others of our species. But these seemingly simple ideas of cooperation and coordination turn out to be devilishly complex in practice, especially in large undertakings. In an organization of any appreciable size, all of the following patterns of cooperation can be found. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was in school, history was one of my least favorite subjects: It just seemed like a bunch of arbitrary names and dates and events that I had to memorize. In hindsight, I realize now, the problem I had with the subject was that it had been &amp;#8220;storified.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we move into the 2020 election season in the US, I thought it might be useful to point out some things that Donald Trump gets right. If you&apos;re concerned about electability, then please pay attention to how your candidates navigate their ways through these seven minefields. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that we&apos;ve had something valuable stolen from us along the way. And the whole modern notion of UX design is one of the thieves that has robbed us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As 2019 winds to a close, and we pause briefly to compose ourselves before finding out what 2020 has in store, I want to take a moment to offer up a prayer &amp;#8211; not to God, but to all of us &amp;#8211; for a more integral sense of who we are in the new year. &lt;/p&gt;

<description>
&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that this conflict between the personal and the institutional is a false dichotomy. While we are right to believe that the ultimate goal of human society is the welfare of the individual persons within that society, it is folly to believe that these ends can be met without participation in and reliance on human institutions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to realize that the current system is, in fact, not broken. Instead, in truth, it is doing exactly what it was designed to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to religion, the main question for most people is whether to keep the one we were raised with or to lose it altogether. But now I&apos;m starting to wonder whether, instead of losing my religion, it might not be better just to rejigger it a bit? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what your age or orientation, it&apos;s hard to gainsay the significance of humankind&apos;s first trip through space to set foot on a celestial body other than our birth planet. Of course fictional space flight has become so common that sitting down for two hours to watch a documentary about a real trip that took place half a century ago might seem like a somewhat pedestrian enterprise. Ah, but there&apos;s where you&apos;d be wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve heard of Trump&apos;s recent attacks on four Democratic congressional representatives, all women of color, urging them to &amp;#8220;go back &amp;#8230; to the crime-infested places from which they came.&amp;#8221; How should Democrats respond? Here are the sorts of positions I&apos;d like to hear them articulate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not quite as old as Biden, and I&apos;ve never served in public office, but I can still share his nostalgia for seemingly simpler times when our political leaders displayed some sort of respect for each other, even when they disagreed over issues of state. However it&apos;s one thing to reveal a preference for certain elements of those bygone days, but quite another to base your presidential run on wishful thinking that those lost elements can somehow be restored in the third decade of the 21st century. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No wonder zombie movies have been popular of late: so many of us feel like increasingly isolated survivors having to fight off forces that we thought were previously vanquished and long buried, forces that seem to be arising all around us, springing at us from all sides. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all sort of know the problems, right? Monopolies. Lock-in. Stream addiction. Reality bubbles. Billionaires seeking market dominance. All other values taking a back seat to growth. I don&apos;t think I need to elaborate. If you&apos;re reading this, then you&apos;re probably well aware of all these concerns. But what do we do about them? Here are a couple of ideas. Radical but practical. And very doable. &lt;/p&gt;
