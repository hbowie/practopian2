<h3><a href="../blog/hbowie/rejiggering-our-religion.html">Rejiggering Our Religion</a></h3>
<p>By Herb Bowie </p>
<p><p>When it comes to religion, the main question for most people is whether to keep the one we were raised with or to lose it altogether. But now I’m starting to wonder whether, instead of losing my religion, it might not be better just to rejigger it a bit?</p>

<p>By Herb Bowie </p>
<p><p>By now I’m sure you’ve heard of Trump’s recent attacks on four Democratic congressional representatives, all women of color, urging them to “go back … to the crime-infested places from which they came.” How should Democrats respond? Here are the sorts of positions I’d like to hear them articulate.</p>

<h3><a href="../quotes/economic-growth-will-not-save-the-global-ecosystem.html">Economic growth will not save the global ecosystem</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><p>Liberalism traditionally relied on economic growth to magically solve difficult social and political conflicts.

<blockquote>
<p><p>In a world deluged by irrelevant information, clarity is power. In theory, anybody can join the debate about the future of humanity, but it is so hard to maintain a clear vision. We might not even notice that a debate is going on, or what the key questions are.</p>

<h3><a href="../appreciation/fruitcakes.html">Fruitcakes</a></h3>
<p>By Herb Bowie </p>
<p><p>I’ve always considered this to be Jimmy Buffet’s masterwork. The musical backing is infectious, swaying and danceable, and the background vocals add depth. The words are cleverly crafted, and perfectly suited to Buffett’s conversational, wisecracking delivery.</p>

<p><p>I learned a lot of things from failure. When you play 162 games, I don’t think any sport emulates life like baseball. You play football once a week or basketball twice. But you start playing baseball, you play every day, day in and day out.</p>
